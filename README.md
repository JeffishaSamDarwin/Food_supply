# 🌍 Surplus Food Distribution System
*A Food Donation and Logistics Platform built on Salesforce*

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project, the **"Surplus Food Distribution System,"** is an application built on the Salesforce platform. Its primary goal is to address food waste by creating a logistics network. It connects food donors (like restaurants, event venues, and hostels) with a network of NGOs and volunteers. This network can then efficiently collect and redistribute surplus food to populations in need.

The system uses core Salesforce technologies—including **custom objects** for the data model, **flows** for automation, and comprehensive **dashboards and reports**—to manage the entire process transparently.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
* To develop a **unified CRM platform** for managing the complete food donation lifecycle.
* To implement **automated communication** (using Salesforce Flows) between donors, NGOs, and volunteers.
* To provide **real-time tracking** for all food donations, from the moment they are logged to final delivery.
* To **decrease food surplus** and support community hunger-relief efforts through technology.
* To create **analytical dashboards and reports** that visualize key impact metrics (e.g., total food saved, people served).
